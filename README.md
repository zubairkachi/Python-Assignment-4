# Python-Assignment-4
Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors 
1]create a file with sample.txt.
2]open the file and enter a text into it.
3]create a python file like read a file.py.
4]variable name file1=with bulti in function open in ("write file name ","mode r").#r==read
5]variable name reading_line1=file1.readline 1 #for printing line by line.
6]variable name reading_line12=file1.readline 2.
7]print line 1.
8]print line2.
9] close the file.
For handling error like filenotfound
1] try:
2]variable name file1=with bulti in function open in ("write file name ","mode r").
3]variable name reading_file1=file1.read()#for reading the file.
4]print reading_file1 #to see what is write in the file.
5]except error name like filenotfounderror:
6]print error: the file is not found #it will not give erroe instead it will print this statement.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
1]create a file with output.txt.#for storing data in the file.
2]create a python file like write and append data file.py
3]variable name file=with bulti in function open in ("write file name ","mode w").# w==write
4]variable name write with datatype str and input to enter user into the file
5]variable name writing_file=file.write(write+"\n")#for writing into the file \n for next line
6]close the  file
7] use if-else statement for Data successfully entered into the output.txt
8]variable name file=with bulti in function open in ("write file name ","mode a").# a==append
9]variable name append with datatype str and input to enter additional text into the file
10]variable name appending_file=file.write(append) 
11]close the file 
12]and use if-else statement for Data successfully entered into the output.txt
13] use read program to print the final contents of the output.txt
14] close the file
